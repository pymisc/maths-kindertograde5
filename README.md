# Structure
* Please note that structure of keeping programs is VERY important. 
* Please create folders with relevant folder name (keep first two digits for better sorting)
* Keeping the progress bar's time variable, preferably using command line ( for example "program-name.py -t 30", where 30 is seconds allowed in between questions) 

# Folder: 01_basic_sums
* This is for keeping basic sums with TKinter
* Sums sheet - two digit number additions (3x5 matrix, 15 questions on one page)
* Single maths sum - add two numbers, with timer / progress bar
* Single maths sum - above one + switch to new sum after previous progress bar finish.
